# ASCII Art Generator

This is a web page that displays the text you enter in different ASCII art formats. 

This program is designed to entertain you and show you what you type in various forms. Enjoy :=)

## Things you need to know when using it:

- The values you see on the screen are organized according to the ASCII table and do not give results for every value. 
- The values you can see the equivalent values are between 32 and 126 in the ASCII table. 
- This range includes characters including spaces:
  
  !"#$%&'()*+,-./0123456789:;<=>?@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[\]^_`abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz{|}~

## How we did it

Mainly we used Go and HTML code. 

But we used a lot of different structures in the background and we did research. 

We even used Python code and libraries to create different ASCII value tables of characters.

Adding the html code of the photo we took as a team to our web page as an image was a challenging but fun process for us.

The most enjoyable part for us was integrating the HTML code of a music list from Spotify with our code.
